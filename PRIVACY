What information do we collect?

The program collects e-mail address and your location. This data is not encrypted.

If you are in debug mode, it also collects information about your device state, like whether it is aware or your location, and the last time it connected to the Internet. Unless you have been asked by the developer to turn on this mode, you probably do not need to use it. The debug mode is off by default.

Whenever an application crashes, the program sends anonymous information about the crash, when in happened, your device model, the application version and version of the operating system you use.

What do we use your information for?

Your e-mail address in used so that other users may find you and send you friend request. Only when you accept their friend request, your location will be shared with them.

Your e-mail address is never used to contact you. Only the people can send you a friend request that have already typed in your full Gmail address. The addresses cannon be searched using wildcards. No messages will be sent to you outside of the application.

The anonymous crash reports that may be sent from your device are only used to improve the application. The e-mail address and location is not being sent with them.

Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

Only when you consent to add somebody as a friend your location may be shared with them.
