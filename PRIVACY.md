**What information do we collect?**

Unless you want to create or edit a community, or create or edit an event, you don't have to log in.

If you do log in, the program collects you Google e-mail address, but you won't be contacted on it. It collects information about the communities or events you create or edit, but it doesn't collect information or whether you attend a particular event.

Whenever an application crashes, the program sends anonymous information about the crash, when in happened, your device model, the application version and version of the operating system you use.

**What do we use your information for?**

Your e-mail address is never used to contact you.

The anonymous crash reports that may be sent from your device are only used to improve the application. The e-mail address and location is not being sent with them.
